# IELTS Vocabulary and Grammar by Band (1–9)

## How to Use This Page

This page is for IELTS candidates and teachers who want a quick, band‑by‑band reference for vocabulary (Lexical Resource) and grammar (Grammatical Range and Accuracy) in Writing and Speaking. Study one band above your current level: notice the new words and structures, copy the example sentences, then adapt them to your own topics. Review out loud for Speaking and rewrite sample sentences for your own Writing Task 1 and Task 2 answers.[^1][^2]

## Band 1–2: Very Limited User

### Summary

At Band 1–2, the test taker can only use a few isolated words or very short memorised phrases. Communication breaks down quickly, and answers in Speaking are usually one or two words. Writing often consists of single words or incomplete sentences. There is almost no control of grammar or spelling.[^2]

### Typical Vocabulary and Grammar at Band 1–2

Vocabulary is mostly basic words about family, work, city, food, likes and dislikes, with many mistakes. Grammar is limited to very simple patterns with the verb "be" and the simple present, often with missing subjects or verbs. Sentences are usually short and may not be complete. Learners at this level should focus on clear, repeated patterns such as "I am…", "I like…", and "I don't like…".

### Examples for Band 1–2

| Type | Item | Usage in IELTS | Example Sentence |
|------|------|----------------|------------------|
| GRAMMAR | I am from… | Use in Speaking Part 1 to answer "Where are you from?" | I am from Vietnam. |
| GRAMMAR | I am a/an… | Use in Speaking Part 1 to say your job or role. | I am a student. |
| GRAMMAR | I like… | Use in Speaking Part 1 to talk about things you enjoy. | I like football. |

### Study Tips (Band 1–2)

Practise reading and saying the same short patterns every day (I am…, I like…, I have…). Record simple answers to common Speaking Part 1 questions and repeat until they are automatic. Focus on being clear and understandable, not fast.

## Band 3–4: Limited User

### Summary

At Band 3–4, the learner can talk about very familiar topics but still has frequent communication breakdowns. Answers are longer than at Band 2 but still simple and repetitive. Writing can produce basic sentences, often with mistakes in tense, spelling, and punctuation. The candidate can usually show overall meaning but not complex ideas.[^3][^2]

### Typical Vocabulary and Grammar at Band 3–4

Vocabulary covers everyday topics such as hobbies, school, daily routine, and simple travel. Learners start using adverbs of frequency like "usually", "sometimes", and "never". Grammar includes the simple present and simple past, "be going to" for future, and basic connectors like "and", "but", and "because". Sentences are often short, but candidates can sometimes join two ideas in one sentence.

### Examples for Band 3–4

### Study Tips (Band 3–4)

Collect very short answers to common Speaking Part 1 questions and add one more idea with "and" or "because". When you write, always try to join two short sentences with a connector like "and" or "but". Repeat key topic words (study, work, family, hobbies) until you can use them without thinking.
