# Task 1 Visual Snapshots for Sample Bank

This document turns each previously created Task 1 sample question into a structured visual "snapshot" so developers and tutors can quickly reconstruct the underlying chart, table, graph, process or map for students. It follows the official overview of Task 1 visual types (line, bar, pie, table, process, map, mixed).[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]

## Visual Types Covered

The six canonical IELTS Academic Task 1 visual categories are all represented across the band 4–9 sample set: bar chart, table, line graph, pie charts, process diagram and maps.[^2][^3][^6][^1]

***

## Band 4 Task 1 Visual Snapshot

### Visual Summary

- **Type:** Vertical bar chart
- **Topic:** Household internet access in four countries
- **Axes:**
  - X-axis: Countries (Argentina, Brazil, Vietnam, Egypt)
  - Y-axis: Percentage of households with internet access (0–80%)
- **Series:** Two series
  - Series 1: Year 2000
  - Series 2: Year 2015

### Suggested Data Layout

| Country   | Year | Internet access (%) |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| Argentina| 2000 | 40                  |
| Brazil   | 2000 | 30                  |
| Vietnam  | 2000 | 10                  |
| Egypt    | 2000 | 5                   |
| Argentina| 2015 | 80                  |
| Brazil   | 2015 | 70                  |
| Vietnam  | 2015 | 40                  |
| Egypt    | 2015 | 15                  |

Values are illustrative, consistent with the narrative description, and designed to show clear growth patterns and contrasts between countries. This aligns with common bar chart patterns used in official and preparation materials.[^7][^4]

## Band 5 Task 1 Visual Snapshot

### Visual Summary

- **Type:** Table (no chart)
- **Topic:** Weekly time use by university students in three countries
- **Dimensions:**
  - Rows: Countries (Country A, Country B, Country C)
  - Columns: Study hours, Part-time work hours, Leisure hours (per week)

### Suggested Data Layout

| Country   | Study (hrs/week) | Part-time work (hrs/week) | Leisure (hrs/week) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| Country A| 30                | 10                         | 15                 |
| Country B| 25                | 10                         | 20                 |
| Country C| 20                | 8                          | 25                 |

The table is simple and readable, supporting comparisons across three categories, which mirrors typical table-only Task 1 questions.[^8][^4]

## Band 6 Task 1 Visual Snapshot

### Visual Summary

- **Type:** Single line graph
- **Topic:** Daily car journeys in a European city (historical + forecast)
- **Axes:**
  - X-axis: Year (1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030)
  - Y-axis: Number of car journeys per day (thousands)
- **Series:** One line ("Daily car journeys")

### Suggested Data Layout

| Year | Daily car journeys (thousands) |
|------|--------------------------------|
| 1990 | 200                            |
| 2000 | 250                            |
| 2010 | 320                            |
| 2020 | 360                            |
| 2030 | 400                            |

Data points show a clear upward trend with slightly faster growth after 2000 and a modest projected rise, reflecting common single-line time series tasks.[^3][^4][^5]

## Band 7 Task 1 Visual Snapshot

### Visual Summary

- **Type:** Two pie charts (before/after comparison)
- **Topic:** Electricity production by source in Country X, 2000 vs 2025
- **Segments (both years):** Coal, Natural gas, Nuclear, Renewables, Other
- **Comparative Frame:** Change in proportions over time

### Suggested Data Layout

**Year 2000**

| Source      | Share of electricity (%) |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Coal        | 45                        |
| Natural gas | 30                        |
| Nuclear     | 10                        |
| Renewables  | 8                         |
| Other       | 7                         |

**Year 2025 (projected)**

| Source      | Share of electricity (%) |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Coal        | 20                        |
| Natural gas | 15                        |
| Nuclear     | 25                        |
| Renewables  | 30                        |
| Other       | 10                        |

These two pie charts illustrate a classic Task 1 comparison: declining fossil fuels and growing nuclear/renewables, a pattern widely used in sample questions.[^9][^8][^1]

## Band 8 Task 1 Visual Snapshot

### Visual Summary

- **Type:** Linear manufacturing process diagram
- **Topic:** Production of bottled orange juice
- **Flow Direction:** Left to right (or top to bottom) through discrete stages

### Suggested Stages

1. **Orange orchards** – Ripe oranges are harvested.
2. **Transport** – Oranges are loaded onto trucks and delivered to the processing plant.
3. **Washing and inspection** – Fruit is washed and checked for quality.
4. **Juicing machine** – Oranges are fed into a mechanical squeezer; juice is extracted.
5. **By-product removal** – Peel and pulp are separated and sent for animal feed or waste.
6. **Filtration** – Raw juice passes through filters to remove remaining solids.
7. **Pasteurisation** – Juice is heated briefly at high temperature, then cooled.
8. **Storage tanks** – Pasteurised juice is pumped into large stainless steel tanks.
9. **Bottling line** – Juice is filled into sterilised bottles, which are then sealed and labelled.
10. **Packaging and distribution** – Bottles are packed into crates and shipped by refrigerated trucks to supermarkets.

This linear, multi-stage process is consistent with common manufacturing diagrams in official and preparation resources.[^10][^4][^3]

## Band 9 Task 1 Visual Snapshot

### Visual Summary

- **Type:** Two maps (past vs present)
- **Topic:** Redevelopment of a coastal town into a tourist resort
- **Time Points:** 1995 and Today
- **Key Features:** Harbour/marina, roads, accommodation, commercial facilities, green space, beach, promenade

### Suggested Map Elements

**Map 1 – 1995 (Before development)**

- **Coastline:** Horizontal beach along the southern edge, labelled "Beach"; used by local residents and fishing boats, no built structures.
- **Harbour:** Small fishing harbour on the eastern side of the beach with a few jetties.
- **Road:** Single narrow country road running parallel to the coast, connecting east and west edges of town.
- **Housing:** Small cluster of houses on the inland side of the road, roughly central.
- **Woodland:** Large wooded area to the north of the houses.
- **Fields:** Open farmland to the east of the harbour.
- **Tourism:** One small guesthouse near the western end of the beach.

**Map 2 – Today (Tourist resort)**

- **Coastline:** Beach still free of buildings but now bordered by a paved pedestrian promenade.
- **Marina:** Harbour removed and replaced by a modern marina with berths for pleasure boats.
- **Road network:** Original road widened into a dual carriageway, with new side streets leading inland.
- **Accommodation:** Several apartment blocks north of the road where fields used to be, plus a large hotel close to the eastern end of the beach.
- **Commercial area:** A shopping complex partially occupying former woodland, with car park access from the main road.
- **Green space:** Woodland reduced but a smaller landscaped park remains.

This configuration mirrors typical map-comparison tasks used to assess the ability to describe spatial changes over time.[^4][^5][^3]

## Developer Notes for Rendering

- Each visual snapshot has been expressed as:
  - A **type** (bar, table, line, pie, process, map).
  - A minimal **data layout** (for graphs/charts/tables) or **stage list / element list** (for process and maps).
- Values and layouts are pedagogical and internally consistent with the written sample answers, while following common Task 1 patterns described in official and major preparation guides.[^6][^1][^2][^3][^9]
- Front-end components can:
  - Render charts from the tabular data (e.g., bar/line/pie) using any chart library.
  - Visualise the process diagram as a node/edge flow.
  - Draw maps schematically from the element lists (boxes, labels, roads, coastline).

If you need, this structure can be mirrored into JSON (one object per Task 1 sample) so the app can dynamically generate both the visual and the corresponding banded answer.
