    const bandsData = [{"bandLabel":"Band 1–2","bandKey":"1–2","bandName":"Very Limited User","summary":"At Band 1–2, the test taker can only use a few isolated words or very short memorised phrases. Communication breaks down quickly, and answers in Speaking are usually one or two words. Writing often consists of single words or incomplete sentences. There is almost no control of grammar or spelling.[^2]","typicalDescription":"Vocabulary is mostly basic words about family, work, city, food, likes and dislikes, with many mistakes. Grammar is limited to very simple patterns with the verb \"be\" and the simple present, often with missing subjects or verbs. Sentences are usually short and may not be complete. Learners at this level should focus on clear, repeated patterns such as \"I am…\", \"I like…\", and \"I don't like…\".","studyTips":"Practise reading and saying the same short patterns every day (I am…, I like…, I have…). Record simple answers to common Speaking Part 1 questions and repeat until they are automatic. Focus on being clear and understandable, not fast.","examples":[{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"I am from…","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to answer \"Where are you from?\"","exampleSentence":"I am from Vietnam."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"I am a/an…","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to say your job or role.","exampleSentence":"I am a student."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"I like…","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to talk about things you enjoy.","exampleSentence":"I like football."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"I don’t like…","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to say what you dislike.","exampleSentence":"I don’t like cold weather."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"family, mother, father","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to answer simple family questions.","exampleSentence":"My family is small. My mother is kind."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"city, country","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to describe your hometown very simply.","exampleSentence":"My city is big. My country is beautiful."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"food, rice, meat","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to talk about food you eat.","exampleSentence":"I like rice and meat."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"work, school","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to say where you go every day.","exampleSentence":"I go to school."}]},{"bandLabel":"Band 3–4","bandKey":"3–4","bandName":"Limited User","summary":"At Band 3–4, the learner can talk about very familiar topics but still has frequent communication breakdowns. Answers are longer than at Band 2 but still simple and repetitive. Writing can produce basic sentences, often with mistakes in tense, spelling, and punctuation. The candidate can usually show overall meaning but not complex ideas.[^3][^2]","typicalDescription":"Vocabulary covers everyday topics such as hobbies, school, daily routine, and simple travel. Learners start using adverbs of frequency like \"usually\", \"sometimes\", and \"never\". Grammar includes the simple present and simple past, \"be going to\" for future, and basic connectors like \"and\", \"but\", and \"because\". Sentences are often short, but candidates can sometimes join two ideas in one sentence.","studyTips":"Collect very short answers to common Speaking Part 1 questions and add one more idea with \"and\" or \"because\". When you write, always try to join two short sentences with a connector like \"and\" or \"but\". Repeat key topic words (study, work, family, hobbies) until you can use them without thinking.","examples":[{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"I usually / sometimes / never + verb","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to describe habits and routines.","exampleSentence":"I usually get up at 7 o’clock and I sometimes go jogging."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"Simple past (I went / I saw / I visited)","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 2 to describe a past experience.","exampleSentence":"Last year I visited my uncle in London."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"be going to + verb","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 or 2 to talk about future plans.","exampleSentence":"Next weekend I am going to see a movie with my friends."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"… and … / … but …","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to connect two simple ideas.","exampleSentence":"I like watching films, but I don’t like watching sports."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"because + clause","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to give a simple reason.","exampleSentence":"I like English because it is useful for my job."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"hobby, enjoy, free time","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 when asked about hobbies.","exampleSentence":"My main hobby is reading, and I enjoy books in my free time."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"usually, sometimes, never","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to make answers more detailed.","exampleSentence":"I usually cook at home, but sometimes I eat in a restaurant."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"travel, ticket, station","usage":"Use in very simple Writing Task 1 sentences about journeys.","exampleSentence":"I bought a ticket at the station yesterday."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"study, subject, exam","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 and simple Task 2 sentences about education.","exampleSentence":"My favourite subject is maths and I study hard for the exam."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"breakfast, lunch, dinner","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 to talk about daily routine.","exampleSentence":"I have a small breakfast and a big dinner with my family."}]},{"bandLabel":"Band 5","bandKey":"5","bandName":"Modest User","summary":"At Band 5, the learner has a partial but functional command of English and can handle basic communication in familiar situations. There are many mistakes, but the overall message is usually clear. Speaking answers are longer and can include simple explanations and comparisons. Writing can produce simple and some compound or complex sentences with basic organisation.[^1][^3]","typicalDescription":"Vocabulary at Band 5 covers common IELTS topics such as education, environment, health, and technology. Learners start to use simple collocations like \"make friends\", \"get a job\", and \"have problems\". Grammar includes simple and compound sentences, with some attempts at complex sentences using \"because\", \"although\", and \"if\". Accuracy is not always high, but there is some variety in structures.","studyTips":"Collect common collocations for big IELTS topics and make your own sentences. When you write, always add a reason or result using \"because\", \"so\", or \"although\". In Speaking, try to give one example after your main idea to sound more developed.","examples":[{"type":"VOCAB","item":"make friends","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 or 2 to talk about social life.","exampleSentence":"It is easy to make friends at university because many students have similar interests."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"get a job","usage":"Use in Writing Task 2 when discussing education or careers.","exampleSentence":"Many young people go to university so they can get a good job in the future."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"have problems with…","usage":"Use in Writing Task 2 to introduce difficulties.","exampleSentence":"Some students have problems with managing their time, so they feel very stressed."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"healthy lifestyle","usage":"Use in Writing Task 2 about health or food.","exampleSentence":"Governments should encourage people to have a healthy lifestyle by providing sports facilities."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"protect the environment","usage":"Use in Writing Task 2 on environmental topics.","exampleSentence":"Individuals can help protect the environment by recycling and using public transport."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"modern technology","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 3 or Writing Task 2.","exampleSentence":"Modern technology makes communication easier, but it can also reduce face‑to‑face interaction."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"Because + clause, main clause","usage":"Use in Writing Task 2 to explain reasons.","exampleSentence":"Because public transport is cheap, many people prefer to use it instead of driving."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"Although + clause, main clause","usage":"Use in Writing Task 2 to show contrast.","exampleSentence":"Although fast food is convenient, it is not very healthy for people."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"If + present, will + verb (first conditional)","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 3 to talk about possible futures.","exampleSentence":"If people do more exercise, they will become healthier."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"Simple time markers (nowadays, in the past, in the future)","usage":"Use in Writing Task 2 to compare time periods.","exampleSentence":"In the past, people wrote letters, but nowadays they usually send emails."},{"type":"GRAMMAR","item":"and / but / so to link clauses","usage":"Use in Writing Task 1 and 2 for longer sentences.","exampleSentence":"The number of cars increased, so the air pollution became worse."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"take exercise / do exercise","usage":"Use in Speaking Part 1 and 2 when talking about health.","exampleSentence":"I try to do exercise three times a week to stay fit."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"cause traffic jams","usage":"Use in Writing Task 2 about cities and transport.","exampleSentence":"More private cars cause traffic jams in many big cities."},{"type":"VOCAB","item":"have access to…","usage":"Use in Writing Task 2 when talking about opportunities.","exampleSentence":"Today, many children have access to the Internet at school and at home."}]},{"bandLabel":"Band 6","bandKey":"6","bandName":"Competent User","summary":"At Band 6, the learner has an effective command of English despite some inaccuracies and misunderstandings. They can use and understand reasonably complex language, especially in familiar academic or everyday topics. Speaking answers are generally fluent, with some hesitation when searching for words. Writing can produce clear paragraphs with topic sentences and supporting details.[^4][^1]","typicalDescription":"Vocabulary at Band 6 includes a wider range of topic‑related and basic academic words such as \"cause\", \"effect\", \"impact\", and \"advantage\". Learners use more precise collocations like \"take measures to\", \"have a negative impact on\", and \"play an important role\". Grammar shows a mix of simple and complex sentences, including relative clauses (who/which/that) and basic conditionals (first and second).
