<!--
This page is structured as a student-friendly IELTS Writing tips hub: a short scoring hero, separate Task 1 and Task 2 sections, a 5-9 band ladder for quick orientation, detailed band cards for each criterion (TA/TR, CC, LR, GRA), and practical tip bundles grouped by target band range; the final JSON block mirrors the same wording and hierarchy so the UI can map tabs, accordions, cards, and drills directly from one source of truth.

# IELTS Writing Tips & Band Guide

## How IELTS Writing is Scored
- IELTS Writing is graded on four equal criteria in each task: `TA/TR`, `CC`, `LR`, `GRA`.
- Your final Writing band combines Task 1 and Task 2.
- `Task 2 counts double`, so strong Task 2 performance has the biggest impact.
- Best strategy: keep Task 1 accurate and efficient, then invest more depth in Task 2.

## Task 1: Visuals & Reports (Academic)

### Band Ladder (5-9)
- `Band 5`: Basic attempt, limited overview, frequent language control issues.
- `Band 6`: Covers main requirements but selection and precision are uneven.
- `Band 7`: Clear overview, logical grouping, good control with some minor slips.
- `Band 8`: Fully covers key features with strong clarity and mostly accurate language.
- `Band 9`: Complete, precise, effortless control across all criteria.
