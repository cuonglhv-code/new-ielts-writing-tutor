# IELTS Writing Tutor Final Pack Index

This index links together all research artifacts created for your IELTS Writing tutor app so you can quickly locate and export the right files. It is based on official IELTS task descriptions and widely used preparation sources for Writing Tasks 1 and 2.[^1][^2][^3]

## 1. Master Guide – Bands, Criteria, Tips

**Asset name:** IELTS Writing Guide  
**Content focus:** Explains official band descriptors for Writing Task 1 and Task 2 (Bands 5–9), highlights the key threshold language (e.g., "sufficiently addresses", "well-developed response"), and provides band‑upgrade tips and JSON schemas for integration into your tutor.

This guide is grounded in the public band descriptors and official explanations of writing criteria from IELTS.org, IDP and the British Council, plus recent high‑band teaching resources.[^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9]

## 2. Sample Bank – Questions & Answers by Band

**Asset name:** IELTS Sample Bank  
**Content focus:** Provides original, copyright‑safe Task 1 and Task 2 sample questions and answers for each band from 4 to 9, along with short meta‑notes justifying the estimated band based on official criteria. Includes a JSON block at the end with task IDs, banded samples, and one‑line notes for app ingestion.

The band profiles are calibrated against official band descriptors and large public collections of band‑labelled essays and answers from major IELTS preparation providers.[^10][^11][^12][^13][^14][^15]

## 3. Task 1 Visual Snapshots – Charts, Diagrams, Maps

**Asset name:** Task1 Visual Specs  
**Content focus:** Turns each Task 1 sample question (bands 4–9) into a precise visual specification: chart type, axes, series, suggested data tables for graphs/tables, and stage/element lists for process diagrams and maps. Designed so your front end can reconstruct the visuals that match the written answers.

Visual patterns follow the official overview of Academic Task 1 question types (line, bar, pie, table, process, maps) and common sample charts used in recent IDP/British Council guidance.[^16][^17][^18][^19][^3][^1]

## 4. How to Use This Pack in Your App

- Use **IELTS Writing Guide** to drive the "Band Descriptors", "Upgrade Paths" and "Tips" screens and to condition tutoring logic by band and criterion.  
- Use **IELTS Sample Bank** to power "Show me an example" actions, band‑comparison views (e.g., 6 vs 7 vs 8), and simulation/explanation workflows using the embedded JSON.  
- Use **Task1 Visual Specs** so the app can render realistic Task 1 graphics that align with the banded answers, making each question visually concrete for learners.

Together, these three artifacts give you criteria, pedagogy, examples, and visuals aligned with current IELTS Academic Writing guidance.[^2][^20][^1]
