## Band Descriptors (Task 1 Academic)

Task 1 is assessed on Task Achievement (TA), Coherence and Cohesion (CC), Lexical Resource (LR) and Grammatical Range & Accuracy (GRA), each worth 25% of the score.  The table below condenses the public band descriptors (Bands 5–9) and adds upgrade tips from Band N → N+1.[^5][^12][^1]

### Task 1 Bands 5–9 by Criterion

| Band | Task Achievement (TA) | Coherence & Cohesion (CC) | Lexical Resource (LR) | Grammar (GRA) |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **9** | **Key phrase:** "fully satisfies all the requirements of the task" and "clearly presents a fully developed response".[^3][^13]  **Upgrade/maintain:** show insightful comparisons, never miss a key feature, and avoid any unnecessary interpretation beyond the data. | **Key phrase:** "uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention" and "skilfully manages paragraphing".[^3][^13]  **Upgrade/maintain:** make paragraphing perfectly logical, rely mainly on reference and substitution rather than obvious linkers, and keep progression effortless. | **Key phrase:** "uses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural and sophisticated control" with only rare slips.[^13]  **Upgrade/maintain:** use precise data verbs ("surged", "levelled off"), topic‑specific nouns, and accurate collocations without showing off. | **Key phrase:** "uses a wide range of structures with full flexibility and accuracy"; errors are only rare slips.[^3][^13]  **Upgrade/maintain:** vary clause types naturally, control complex noun phrases, and keep even long sentences error‑free. |
| **8** | **Key phrase:** "covers all requirements of the task sufficiently" and "presents, highlights and illustrates key features… clearly and appropriately".[^3][^11][^13]  **Band 7→8:** add more specific numerical support to each key feature, avoid minor omissions, and ensure every bullet in the question is clearly addressed. | **Key phrase:** "sequences information and ideas logically" and "manages all aspects of cohesion well" with appropriate paragraphing.[^3][^11]  **Band 7→8:** eliminate minor mechanical linking (no over‑use of "moreover"), keep one clear focus per paragraph, and ensure smooth progression between detail groups. | **Key phrase:** "uses a wide range of vocabulary fluently and flexibly to convey precise meanings" with only occasional collocation errors.[^3][^11]  **Band 7→8:** upgrade basic verbs ("go up") to precise ones ("climbed steadily"), add range in quantifiers ("a marginal share", "the bulk of"), and remove any guessing with unfamiliar words.[^14][^15] | **Key phrase:** "uses a wide range of structures" and "the majority of sentences are error‑free" with only very occasional errors.[^3][^11]  **Band 7→8:** reduce small agreement/article errors, control complex conditionals and relative clauses, and vary sentence openings (not all starting with the subject). |
| **7** | **Key phrase:** "covers the requirements of the task" and (Academic) "presents a clear overview of main trends, differences or stages".[^3][^13]  **Band 6→7:** always include a 1–2 sentence overview highlighting 2–3 biggest trends, group data instead of listing, and avoid explaining reasons for the data.[^16][^17] | **Key phrase:** "logically organises information and ideas; there is clear progression throughout" and "uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately although there may be some under‑/over‑use".[^3][^11][^13]  **Band 6→7:** use a stable 4‑paragraph structure (intro, overview, 2 detail paras), avoid over‑linking with basic connectors, and use reference words ("this figure", "these countries") to cut repetition.[^18][^19] | **Key phrase:** "uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision" and uses less common items with some awareness of style.[^3][^13]  **Band 6→7:** add trend phrases ("peaked at", "remained relatively stable"), comparative language ("significantly higher"), and topic‑specific nouns ("proportion", "fluctuation") while keeping spelling accurate.[^20][^15] | **Key phrase:** "uses a variety of complex structures" and "produces frequent error‑free sentences" with good control of grammar and punctuation.[^3][^13]  **Band 6→7:** ensure each paragraph contains multiple error‑free complex sentences, fix recurring tense and article patterns, and check commas around subordinate clauses. |
| **6** | **Key phrase:** "the response focuses on the requirements of the task" and key features "are covered and adequately" though not always well selected.[^1][^13]  **Band 5→6:** reach at least 150 words, mention all key groups/time periods, and avoid writing about every small detail or single data point.[^14][^15] | **Key phrase:** "arranges information and ideas coherently and there is a clear overall progression" but cohesion may be "faulty or mechanical" and referencing not always clear.[^11][^13]  **Band 5→6:** split into clear paragraphs, link similar data together, and replace repeated nouns with pronouns or synonyms. | **Key phrase:** "uses an adequate range of vocabulary for the task" and attempts less common words with some inaccuracy.[^11][^13]  **Band 5→6:** learn reliable paraphrases for the graph title, avoid repeating numbers with the same verb, and fix common spelling/word‑form errors that confuse the reader.[^20] | **Key phrase:** uses a mix of simple and more complex sentence forms, but errors in grammar and punctuation sometimes cause difficulty for the reader.[^11][^15]  **Band 5→6:** control basic tenses, use simple complex patterns ("while", "whereas"), and proof‑read for sentence fragments and run‑ons. |
| **5** | **Key phrase:** "generally addresses the task; the format may be inappropriate in places" and often "recounts detail mechanically with no clear overview" while key features are only inadequately covered.[^21][^11][^13]  **Band 5→6:** stop copying the graph, summarise 3–4 main trends, and add units/time references directly from the visual. | **Key phrase:** "presents information with some organisation but there may be a lack of overall progression" and makes "inadequate, inaccurate or over‑use of cohesive devices" with repetition due to weak referencing.[^21][^11][^13]  **Band 4→5→6:** move from one long paragraph to at least 3, reduce repeated linkers at sentence starts, and keep related numbers together instead of jumping between categories. | **Key phrase:** "uses a limited range of vocabulary, but this is minimally adequate for the task" with noticeable errors in spelling/word formation that may cause difficulty.[^21][^13]  **Band 4→5→6:** learn core academic reporting lexis ("increase", "decrease", "respectively"), avoid informal words ("stuff", "thing"), and correct high‑frequency spelling errors that block meaning.[^15] | **Key phrase:** "uses only a limited range of structures"; attempts at complex sentences are less accurate than simple ones and frequent grammatical and punctuation errors cause difficulty.[^21][^13]  **Band 4→5→6:** master accurate simple sentences first, then add one clause at a time ("while X rose, Y fell"), and always end sentences with a full stop. |

***

## Band Descriptors (Task 2 Academic / General)

Task 2 is assessed on Task Response (TR) instead of Task Achievement, but the other three criteria remain the same and Task 2 counts for twice as much as Task 1 in the Writing score.  The descriptors were updated but the core meanings of Bands 5–9 are stable across recent public versions.[^2][^4][^6][^9][^1][^5]

### Task 2 Bands 5–9 by Criterion

| Band | Task Response (TR) | Coherence & Cohesion (CC) | Lexical Resource (LR) | Grammar (GRA) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **9** | **Key phrase:** "fully addresses all parts of the task" and "presents a fully developed position" with relevant, fully extended and well supported ideas.[^1][^22][^6]  **Band 8→9:** ensure every paragraph deepens the same clear stance, use specific but believable examples, and avoid formulaic conclusions. | **Key phrase:** "uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention" with clear overall progression.[^22][^19][^9]  **Band 8→9:** rely mainly on logical development and referencing rather than obvious linkers, keep one controlling idea per paragraph, and avoid any sudden topic shifts. | **Key phrase:** "uses a wide range of vocabulary" with very natural and sophisticated control, with rare minor errors as slips.[^22][^23]  **Band 8→9:** use precise academic lexis that fits the topic, control collocations, and keep idioms/clichés out of essays.[^7][^9] | **Key phrase:** "uses a wide range of structures with full flexibility and accuracy"; most sentences are error‑free with only rare slips.[^22][^9]  **Band 8→9:** vary clause types (relative, conditional, concessive) without over‑length, and maintain accurate punctuation in all complex sentences. |
| **8** | **Key phrase:** "sufficiently addresses all parts of the task" and "presents a well‑developed response" with relevant, extended and supported ideas.[^22][^9]  **Band 7→8:** remove any partially developed ideas, support each main point with a concrete example, and avoid over‑generalised claims or invented statistics.[^7][^9] | **Key phrase:** "sequences information and ideas logically" and "manages all aspects of cohesion well" with appropriate paragraphing.[^22][^9]  **Band 7→8:** tighten topic sentences so each paragraph clearly answers part of the question, use reference/substitution to reduce repetition, and avoid over‑using basic linkers ("firstly", "moreover").[^24][^25][^7] | **Key phrase:** "uses a wide range of vocabulary" fluently and flexibly to convey precise meanings, with occasional inaccuracies.[^22][^7]  **Band 7→8:** add precise cause/effect and stance verbs ("undermines", "mitigates"), topic‑specific noun phrases ("income inequality", "curriculum reform"), and collocations typical of essays.[^7][^9] | **Key phrase:** "uses a wide range of structures"; majority of sentences are error‑free and only very occasional errors/inappropriacies occur.[^22][^9]  **Band 7→8:** eliminate recurring grammar patterns (articles, agreement, prepositions), vary sentence length for rhythm, and keep complex structures clear rather than overloaded. |
| **7** | **Key phrase:** "addresses all parts of the task" and "presents a clear position throughout the response"; main ideas are presented, extended and supported, though there may be over‑generalisation or loss of focus.[^22][^6]  **Band 6→7:** ensure the thesis directly answers the question, repeat the same stance in conclusion, and extend each idea with explanation plus specific example (PEEL). [^7][^26] | **Key phrase:** "logically organises information and ideas; there is clear progression" and uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately, though some under/over‑use may occur.[^22][^24]  **Band 6→7:** use a stable 4‑ or 5‑paragraph structure, ensure each body paragraph has one clear central idea, and avoid long lists of undeveloped points.[^24][^7][^9] | **Key phrase:** "uses a sufficient range of vocabulary" to allow some flexibility and precision and uses less common items with some awareness of style and collocation.[^22][^7]  **Band 6→7:** add band‑appropriate academic phrases ("a compelling argument", "from a broader perspective"), avoid informal language, and fix frequent spelling/word‑form issues. | **Key phrase:** "uses a variety of complex structures" and produces frequent error‑free sentences with good control of grammar and punctuation, though a few errors remain.[^22][^9]  **Band 6→7:** ensure each paragraph contains several error‑free complex sentences, check tense consistency, and correct comma splices and sentence fragments. |
| **6** | **Key phrase:** "addresses all parts of the task although some parts may be more fully covered than others"; presents a relevant position although conclusions may become unclear or repetitive and some ideas are not fully developed.[^22][^1]  **Band 5→6:** answer every part of the question explicitly, avoid changing opinion mid‑essay, and add one explanation and one example for each main point.[^7][^27] | **Key phrase:** "arranges information and ideas coherently and there is a clear overall progression" but cohesion within/between sentences may be faulty or mechanical and referencing may be unclear.[^22][^24]  **Band 5→6:** start body paragraphs with clear topic sentences, connect sentences with cause/effect rather than random linkers, and use pronouns correctly. | **Key phrase:** "uses an adequate range of vocabulary" but may make errors in word choice, spelling and/or word formation that do not impede communication.[^22][^7]  **Band 5→6:** replace vague words ("things", "a lot") with topic‑related nouns, learn 2–3 reliable collocations per common topic, and proof‑read for obvious spelling errors. | **Key phrase:** "uses a mix of simple and complex sentence forms" but "makes some errors in grammar and punctuation" which may cause difficulty.[^22][^7]  **Band 5→6:** practise a small set of safe complex patterns (if‑clauses, relative clauses, concessive "although"), and prioritise accuracy over complexity. |
| **5** | **Key phrase:** "generally addresses the task" but may focus on only one part; presents a position but it may be unclear, and main ideas are limited, not well developed or irrelevant.[^22][^21]  **Band 4→5→6:** analyse the question for all parts, state a direct opinion in the introduction, and avoid memorised generic content.[^7][^9] | **Key phrase:** "presents information and ideas but these are not arranged coherently" and there is no clear progression; cohesive devices may be inaccurate or repetitive and paragraphing may be confusing or absent.[^22][^21]  **Band 4→5→6:** move from one large block of text to clear paragraphs, use only a few basic linkers accurately, and keep each paragraph on one idea. | **Key phrase:** "uses only basic vocabulary" which may be repetitive or inappropriate for the task and has limited control of word formation/spelling.[^22][^21]  **Band 4→5→6:** expand general topic vocabulary (education, environment, health, technology), avoid slang and contractions, and correct high‑frequency spelling mistakes that block meaning. | **Key phrase:** "uses only a limited range of structures" and cannot consistently produce complex sentences; frequent grammar and punctuation errors cause difficulty for the reader.[^22][^21]  **Band 4→5→6:** write shorter, clearer sentences first, then add basic complex structures, and always separate sentences with full stops instead of commas. |

## Master Tips Bible (Accordion Sections)

### Task 1 Tips

- **Planning (All Bands)**: Spend 3 minutes to read the question, identify units/time, circle extremes, and note 2–3 biggest trends.[^14][^17]
- **Structure (All Bands)**: Use four paragraphs – paraphrased introduction, overview, and two body paragraphs grouped by category or time.[^18][^28]
- **Overview Priority (Band 6→7)**: Always write an overview that summarises overall trends without numbers; missing it usually caps TA at Band 6.[^3][^16][^17]
- **Key Feature Selection (Band 6→8)**: Select 3–4 key features (highest/lowest, biggest changes, notable similarities) and ignore minor fluctuations.[^28][^29]
- **Data Grouping (Band 6→7)**: Group data logically (e.g., years 1990–2000 vs 2000–2010, or countries with similar values) instead of describing categories one by one.[^15][^18]
- **Detail Paragraphs (Band 7+)**: Use one paragraph for the main increasing/decreasing group and one for contrasting or stable groups to show comparison.[^16][^29]
- **No Opinions (All Bands)**: Describe only what the graph shows; do not explain reasons or make predictions, which can hurt TA.[^30][^3]
- **Word Count Discipline (Band 5→6)**: Aim for 170–190 words to fully cover key features without wasting time or drifting off‑topic.[^17][^28]
- **Time Management (All Bands)**: Finish Task 2 first in 35–40 minutes, then limit Task 1 to 18–20 minutes so Task 2 can drive the overall score.[^29][^10]
- **Task Type Awareness (Band 6→7)**: Learn separate patterns for trends over time, comparisons at one time, and processes/maps, but keep one flexible template for all.[^31][^17]

- **Band 7+ Vocab – Trends**: Use precise verbs such as "rose gradually", "plummeted", "peaked at", "levelled off", "remained relatively stable" instead of repeating "increase"/"decrease".[^15]
- **Band 7+ Vocab – Comparisons**: Use phrases like "was significantly higher than", "lagged behind", "roughly the same as", "by far the largest share".[^15]
- **Band 7+ Vocab – Proportions**: Employ "just under a third", "approximately half", "a small minority", "the vast majority" to avoid raw percentages.[^15]
- **Band 7+ Vocab – Processes**: For diagrams, use verbs like "is transported to", "is processed", "is converted into", "is subsequently packaged".[^32][^15]
- **Avoid Informal Language (All Bands)**: Replace "stuff", "things", "a lot of" with "items", "factors", "a substantial proportion".[^33][^15]

- **Band 8 Grammar – Passives**: Use the passive for processes ("the mixture is heated", "the liquid is filtered") to shift focus to actions rather than people.[^32][^15]
- **Band 8 Grammar – Comparatives**: Use comparative structures like "X was nearly twice as high as Y" or "A grew more rapidly than B over the period".[^15]
- **Band 8 Grammar – Complex Sentences**: Combine data with subordinators ("while", "whereas", "although") to compare trends in one sentence accurately.[^15]
- **Band 7 Accuracy Goal**: Aim for mostly error‑free simple and complex sentences; a few minor errors are acceptable, but not repeated patterns.[^11][^3]
- **Tense Control (All Bands)**: Use past tense for completed time periods, present for timeless diagrams/maps, and present perfect only when a period continues to now.[^28]

- **Paragraphing Visibility (Band 6→7)**: Leave a clear blank line between paragraphs so examiners can immediately see the structure, including on computer‑delivered tests.[^18][^17]
- **Linkers – Use Sparingly (Band 7+)**: Use a small set of accurate linkers ("overall", "in contrast", "meanwhile") and rely more on logical progression than on connectors.[^19][^25]
- **Referencing (Band 7+)**: Use reference words such as "this figure", "these countries", "the former" to avoid repeating long category names.[^24][^25]
- **Units & Labels (All Bands)**: Mention the measurement ("millions", "%", "US dollars") and time frame in the introduction to show control of the data.[^34]
- **Checking Phase (All Bands)**: Reserve 2 minutes to check numbers, units and plurals, as inaccurate data and agreement errors can drag TA and GRA below 7.[^30][^28]

### Task 2 Tips

- **Band 7 Structure (All Question Types)**: Use a clear four‑paragraph essay – introduction with thesis, two main body paragraphs (one key reason each), and a short conclusion.[^7][^35][^9]
- **Thesis Clarity (Band 6→7)**: State your opinion directly in the introduction ("This essay argues that…") and keep the same stance throughout.[^26][^27][^7]
- **Question Analysis (All Bands)**: Identify how many parts the question has (e.g., discuss both views + your opinion = three parts) and plan at least one sentence for each.[^9][^7]
- **Body Paragraph Focus (Band 6→7)**: Give each body paragraph one main idea, then follow PEEL: Point → Explanation → Example → Link.[^24][^7]
- **Length & Depth (Band 7+)**: Aim for 270–320 words with fully developed ideas rather than very long but unfocused essays.[^36][^7]
- **Task 2 First (All Bands)**: Do Task 2 before Task 1 so the heavier‑weighted essay gets your best time and concentration.[^37][^10]

- **Band 8 Cohesion – Linkers**: Prefer phrase‑level linkers such as "The main reason for this is that…", "A further consequence is…", "In contrast" rather than over‑using "Firstly/Secondly".[^7][^9][^24]
- **Band 8 Cohesion – Referencing**: Use "this trend", "these measures", "such a policy" to connect sentences and avoid repetition while keeping meaning clear.[^25][^24]
- **Paragraph Progression (Band 7+)**: Start each paragraph with a topic sentence that answers part of the question, and end with a mini‑conclusion that links back to your thesis.[^9][^24]
- **Avoid Template Over‑Use (Band 7+)**: Use flexible structures from good models (e.g., IELTS Simon, Liz), but avoid copying memorised paragraphs, which can be penalised.[^38][^26]

- **Band 7–8 Lexis – Argument Phrases**: Use compact academic expressions like "a compelling argument", "it is widely believed that", "from a broader perspective", "it is undeniable that".[^7][^9]
- **Band 7–8 Lexis – Cause & Effect**: Use verbs such as "leads to", "results in", "contributes to", "stems from", "can be attributed to".[^9][^7]
- **Band 7–8 Lexis – Evaluation**: Use phrases such as "a more viable solution", "long‑term consequences", "short‑sighted policies", "socially desirable outcomes".[^7][^9]
- **Avoid Over‑Complex Words (All Bands)**: Prefer natural academic English over obscure words (avoid "hitherto", "denizens", "myopic view" for IELTS essays).[^7]
- **No Idioms/Slang (All Bands)**: Avoid idioms, clichés and slang ("hit the nail on the head", "gonna"), which sound informal or memorised.[^9][^7]

- **Band 8 Grammar – Range**: Demonstrate control of conditionals, relative clauses, passive structures and nominalisation without making sentences over‑long.[^9][^7]
- **Band 8 Grammar – Accuracy**: Aim for mostly error‑free sentences and fix recurring errors in articles, prepositions, and subject‑verb agreement.[^7][^9]
- **Sentence Length Control (All Bands)**: Mix short, medium and longer sentences so complex structures remain readable and do not hide mistakes.[^24][^9]
- **Position Consistency (Band 7+)**: Ensure every body paragraph supports the same clear opinion; do not switch sides in the final paragraph.[^39][^26]
- **Realistic Examples (All Bands)**: Use plausible examples from education, work or daily life instead of fake statistics, which examiners may distrust.[^9][^7]

- **Topic Hacks – Environment (Band 7+)**: Prepare collocations such as "reduce carbon emissions", "invest in renewable energy", "introduce congestion charges", "protect biodiversity", "promote sustainable consumption".[^7][^9]
- **Topic Hacks – Education (Band 7+)**: Use phrases like "standardised testing", "continuous assessment", "curriculum reform", "equal access to education", "teacher‑centred vs student‑centred approaches".[^38][^7]
- **Topic Hacks – Technology (Band 7+)**: Use bundles such as "automation of routine tasks", "data privacy concerns", "digital divide", "remote collaboration tools".[^40][^7]
- **Topic Hacks – Society (Band 7+)**: Prepare phrases like "ageing population", "income inequality", "social cohesion", "cultural homogenisation".[^9][^7]
- **Reddit Insight – Pushing 7→8**: High‑scoring candidates report that the jump from 7 to 8 often comes from clearer positions and deeper idea development, not just better language.[^41][^42][^36]

***

## Band Upgrade Paths

### Task 1 Upgrade Path

- **Band 5 → 6 (Stabilise basics)**: Reach 170+ words focused on the task, include the units/time frame, avoid copying the question, and move from listing all numbers to summarising key trends.[^21][^15]
- **Band 6 → 7 (Add overview & grouping)**: Add a separate overview paragraph with 2–3 key features, group data logically into two detail paragraphs, and avoid explanations or opinions about causes.[^3][^16][^29]
- **Band 7 → 8 (Precision & control)**: Strengthen numerical support for each key feature, refine vocabulary for trends/comparisons, and reduce minor grammar and cohesion issues to occasional slips.[^29][^3][^28]
- **Band 8 → 9 (Sophisticated summarising)**: Provide slightly deeper but still concise analysis of relationships in the data, maintain virtually invisible cohesion, and keep both lexis and grammar natural and flexible.[^41][^3][^28]

### Task 2 Upgrade Path

- **Band 5 → 6 (Answer fully & clearly)**: Address all parts of the question, state a clear position, avoid off‑topic content, and give at least one explanation and example for each main idea.[^22][^27][^7]
- **Band 6 → 7 (Balanced paragraphs)**: Use a consistent structure (intro, 2 body paragraphs, conclusion), keep one main idea per paragraph, and develop ideas with explanation plus specific, relevant examples.[^24][^7][^9]
- **Band 7 → 8 (Depth & cohesion)**: Increase depth of analysis ("why" and "so what"), use more precise academic lexis, and make cohesion rely on logical progression and referencing rather than frequent linking phrases.[^36][^7][^9]
- **Band 8 → 9 (Sophistication & control)**: Demonstrate nuanced positions (e.g., weighing conditions or trade‑offs), use a wide range of natural collocations, and sustain near‑perfect grammatical accuracy and paragraphing.[^22][^26][^41]

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes (Task 1 & 2)

### Frequent Problems and Remedies

| Band Level | Issue (Criterion) | Example Candidate Behaviour | Fix Tip |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| 5 (TA/TR) | Off‑topic or partial answer | Writes about advantages of technology when the question asks about its effects on children only. | Underline keywords in the question, list all parts (topic + task + perspective), and check each paragraph against this list before writing the conclusion.[^7][^27] |
| 5 (CC) | One‑paragraph essay | Writes full answer as a single block with no clear paragraphing. | Plan 4 paragraphs (intro, 2 bodies, conclusion) and press Enter twice between paragraphs so structure is visually obvious.[^24][^18] |
| 5 (LR) | Repetition & informal words | Repeats "a lot of problems" and "things" throughout the essay. | Replace vague nouns with topic‑specific ones ("challenges", "issues", "factors") and learn 5–10 core collocations per common topic.[^7][^15] |
| 5 (GRA) | Fragmented or run‑on sentences | Writes "Because people use cars more. The pollution increasing" as two incorrect sentences. | Practise combining clauses correctly ("Because people use cars more, pollution is increasing") and ensure each sentence has one main verb. |
| 6 (TA) | Over‑detailed Task 1 description | Tries to describe every number in the chart sequentially. | Choose the 3–4 most important patterns and ignore small fluctuations; this shows selection and highlights key features, which Band 7+ requires.[^3][^16][^29] |
| 6 (TR) | Weak or shifting position | States a neutral view in the introduction but seems to agree and disagree in different body paragraphs. | Decide your stance before writing, express it clearly in the thesis, support it consistently, and restate it in the conclusion.[^26][^39] |
| 6 (CC) | Mechanical linking | Starts most sentences with "Firstly", "Secondly", "Thirdly", "Moreover". | Use a variety of cohesive devices, including reference words and logical sequencing, and avoid starting every sentence with a linker.[^24][^25][^9] |
| 6 (LR) | Inaccurate synonyms | Forces rare words learned from lists, leading to wrong collocations. | Use only words you can use confidently, prioritising accurate collocations over fancy vocabulary; examiners reward appropriateness, not flashiness.[^7][^9] |
| 6 (GRA) | Frequent small errors | Shows good ideas but many article/preposition mistakes. | Keep complex structures slightly simpler, learn your top 5 recurring error patterns, and check specifically for those in the last 3 minutes.[^7][^9] |
| 7 (TA/TR) | Insufficient support | Gives strong topic sentences but only a brief explanation and no clear example. | For each main idea, add at least one sentence explaining "why" and one that gives a specific, realistic example or scenario.[^7][^26] |
| 7 (CC) | Slightly unbalanced essay | One body paragraph is twice as long as the other with multiple ideas mixed. | Aim for similar paragraph length and commit to one main point per paragraph, adding depth rather than new ideas.[^24][^7] |
| 7 (LR) | Topic vocabulary still limited | Uses good general English but lacks precise lexis for specialised topics (e.g., climate policy, online education). | Build small lexical sets (8–10 items) for high‑frequency topics, focusing on collocations, not just individual words.[^7][^9] |
| 7–8 (GRA) | Occasional awkwardness | Grammar mostly accurate but some long sentences feel overloaded and hard to follow. | Break very long sentences into two, keep one main clause plus one subordinate clause, and cut unnecessary relative clauses or extra phrases.[^24][^9] |

## Model Snippets

### Task 1 Line Graph – Band 7 Overview

- **Band 7 Overview Sentence:** "Overall, all three countries saw a rise in internet usage over the period, with Nation A remaining the clear leader throughout."  
This gives a clear overview with two main trends (overall rise; A leading), matching Band 7 expectations.[^16][^3]

### Task 1 Line Graph – Band 9 Overview

- **Band 9 Overview Sentence:** "Overall, internet usage increased markedly in all three countries, with Nation A consistently ahead, while Nations B and C experienced the most dramatic growth after 2015."  
This adds more precise comparative insight while remaining concise, aligned with Band 9 task achievement and coherence.[^3][^41][^16]

### Task 2 Opinion Essay – Band 7 Introduction

- **Band 7 Intro (Agree/Disagree):** "Many people argue that governments should prioritise public transport over road expansion. This essay agrees with this view and will explain why investing in buses and trains can reduce congestion and protect the environment."  
The thesis clearly answers the question and signals two reasons, suiting Band 7 TR.[^26][^7]

### Task 2 Opinion Essay – Band 9 Introduction

- **Band 9 Intro (Agree/Disagree):** "Although road building has long been a popular response to traffic congestion, this essay argues that redirecting funds towards efficient public transport is a far more sustainable solution, as it both limits car dependency and delivers broader social benefits."  
This introduction takes a nuanced stance and previews extended arguments consistent with Band 9 descriptors.[^22][^26]

### Vocab Glossary (20 High‑Value Phrases)

1. **Band 7+ Task 1 – Trends:** "rose gradually", "fell sharply", "remained relatively stable", "peaked at", "bottomed out", "levelled off".[^15]

4. **Band 7+ Task 2 – Argument:** "a compelling argument", "it is widely believed that", "from a broader perspective", "a more viable solution".[^7][^9]
5. **Band 7+ Task 2 – Cause/Effect:** "stems from", "gives rise to", "results in", "can be attributed to".[^9][^7]
6. **Band 7+ Task 2 – Evaluation:** "short‑sighted policy", "long‑term consequences", "socially desirable outcome", "environmentally sustainable".[^7][^9]

### Grammar Glossary (20 Structures to Practise)

1. **Contrast clauses:** "Although X is true, Y…" (show nuanced argument).[^9][^7]
2. **Reason clauses:** "Since / As / Because X, Y…" (explain causes).
